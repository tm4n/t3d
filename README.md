# t3d

This engine is being written for the rewrite of the Survive! video game.
It's very simple and doesn't offer advanced scene management or much customization in general. All is tailored for a small and simple 3d world. 

Should work on Windows, Linux and Android.

Dependencies:
SDL2
SDL2-mixer
SDL2-ttf
glm

Compatible asset formats are very limited:
TGA for images only uncompressed and 24/32 bits)
MDL5 for 3d models (supporting frame animations)
ttf for fonts
wav for sound, though others could easily be supported through SDL-mixer
