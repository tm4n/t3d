# t3d

This engine is being written for the rewrite of the Survive! video game.
It's very simple and doesn't offer advanced scene management or much customization in general. All is tailored for a small and simple 3d world. Compatible asset formats are very limited:

Should work on Windows, Linux and Android.

### Dependencies:
 - SDL2
 - SDL2-mixer
 - SDL2-ttf
 - glm

### Asset formats
 - TGA for images only uncompressed and 24/32 bits)
 - MDL5 for 3d models (supporting frame animations)
 - ttf for fonts
 - wav for sound, though others could easily be supported through SDL-mixer
